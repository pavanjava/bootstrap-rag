Semantic Router is a superfast decision-making layer for your LLMs and agents. Rather than waiting for slow LLM generations to make tool-use decisions, we use the magic of semantic vector space to make those decisions â€” routing our requests using semantic meaning.

### How to execute code
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
